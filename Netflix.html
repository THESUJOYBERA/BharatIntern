<!-----first question------>
        <li>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="first">
            <label for="first"> What is Netflix?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Netflix is the original major streaming option for home television audiences. When it started nearly 20 years ago, Netflix was a subscription-based DVD service that would mail DVDs straight to your home. It still does that too (more on that later), but in 2007, Netflix debuted its streaming service, allowing viewers to watch thousands of on-demand TV shows and movies ad-free. Ten years later, Netflix has become one of the biggest names in entertainment, producing critically acclaimed TV shows (Daredevil, House of Cards, Stranger Things, and Luke Cage, to quickly name four) and movies and hosting original comedy specials.</p>

<!---second question----->

        <li>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="second">
            <label for="second"> How does Netflix work?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p> If you’ve ever used a streaming service, Netflix’s interface will be instantly familiar, but even for first timers, getting started is a breeze. Your primary source of movies will be your queue. As you look through content on the Netflix website and app, you’ll see a little plus sign in a circle. This button adds things to your queue for later viewing. </p>
            </div>
        </li>

<!-----3rd question----->

        <li>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="third">
            <label for="third"> What can I watch on Netflix? </label>
            <div class="content">
                <p> Netflix’s library contains a broad range of hit movies and shows from major networks. TV series like Arrow, The Flash, Scandal, Grey’s Anatomy, and The Walking Dead come to the service a few months after their official airdate. </p>
            </div>
        </li>

<!---4th question--->

        <li>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="fourth">
            <label for="fourth"> How much data does Netflix use?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p> A lot, but that might not matter depending on your mobile and internet plans, and it’s easy enough to adjust. Here’s a breakdown of how much data Netflix uses:<br>

    Low: Basic video quality uses up to 0.3 GB of data per hour<br>
    Medium: Standard video quality uses up to 0.7 GB of data per hour<br>
    High: Best video quality uses up to 3 GB of data per hour for HD and 7 GB of data per hour for Ultra HD<br>
    Automatic: Quality determined by your connection<br>
    Unlimited: The highest quality possible for your device and the show or movie you’re watching, peaks at the same rate as High.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

<!----5th question---->

        <li>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="fifth">
            <label for="fifth"> Can you download with Netflix? </label>
            <div class="content">
                <p> If you watch a lot of video on the road and want to save your data, Netflix has a leg up on the competition. You can easily download videos to their smartphones and tablets so you can keep the entertainment rolling even on the road without killing your cell phone bill. It’s easy. Jut look for the white download arrow on whatever you’re watching.</p>
            </div>
        </li>

<!-----6th question----->

        <li>
            <input type="radio" name="accordion" id="sixth">
            <label for="sixth">Is Netflix good for kids?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Netflix has so much amazing content for kids. In addition to the old classics, it also puts out new Netflix kids' shows nearly every month. And the kids' shows on Netflix aren't junk, either. Sure, there are series that are just for fun.</p>
